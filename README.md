## Technical Skills and Techs
### Web dev
I am proficent in Javascript programming. On the frontend, both inside a framework (as **VueJS**) or Vanilla, and on the backend in **Node**. My go-to stack for a full-stack application, when the complexity requires a structured approach, is usually VueJS + Express (Node) + PostgreSQL. Database wise, I know SQL well and I used several NoSQL DBs as CouchDB, MongoDB and Azure Cosmos DB. I have some experience with **Firebase** also.

### Mobile - Cross Platform
I enjoy **Flutter** as a mobile dev platform; I also used **Ionic Capacitor** to deploy hybrid apps.

### Infrastructure and Other Proficencies
I know **Java** and **C#** and I learned all the basics of programming in **C**. I enjoy writing **Ruby**. I use **Docker** daily to deploy and manage my applications; being a fan of Infrastructure as Code I also learnt **Terraform**. 

## What I want to learn
I want to become more proficent in using my OSes: from scripting languages for Windows (as Powershell) to the internals of Linux, as systemd. Systems programming wise I want to learn some new language, as **Zig** or **Rust**; I am also very interested in the **BEAM** VM programming languages, expecially **Elixir**, which has been on my to-study list for too long now.
