## Interests and study topics 💻
Through school and university I got in touch with a variety of different technologies and practices: this offered me the chance to understand which are the aspects of CS that I like more.
- I'm proficent with **Java** and **C**, as they're the ones taught extensively in university
- I know **Python** but it's far from being my favourite language to work with
- I love **Ruby** 💎 
- From the DB side, I worked with **MySQL** and **SQLite**, while from the non relational side I have experience with **CouchDB**
- I'm studying **Rust** when I find time to do that 😆
- I love unconditionally **LaTeX**
- I also got in touch with several other technologies while in university, here in random order:
  * NodeJS
  * Typescript
  * Ionic
  * Docker
  * FPGA programming with VHDL
  * Parallel programming frameworks as OpenMP and MPI
  * Pure functional programming in Haskell
  * Distributed programming in Erlang
