# Hello there
This is a first blog post of what I consider my personal blog. I do not know how to "run" a personal blog, so I will keep posting stuff here, to publish it, share it, save it, note it or reorganize it. Let's see where this goes!

## Things I usually nerd about
+ Lists
+ Coding
+ Dungeons and Dragons
+ Sci Fi books
+ Computer science in general
+ Rugby
+ Lead Climbing
+ System Administration, or DevOps as the cool kids call it nowadays
